# bike-shop
This is a desktop application made by me called Bike Shop.
For making this app Qt Creator and C++ was used.

Here are the steps that I needed to fulfill: 

  Create a Bike shop application. The goal of the application is to make it easier for the owner of a bike shop to work. The application has the following functionality:
  -Only registered users have access to the application (login and registration form, user authentication)
  -Tab with display of items
  -Tab for creating items (including bike attributes such as price, frame size, condition (new, used), number of gears, etc.)
  -Created items should be saved in an SQL database (the SQL database can be of your choice: MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
  -Dashboard tab - the home page includes a dashboard, a simple user overview of the current state (number of available bikes) and an estimate of income in [BAM] based     on active items
  -If there are only two bikes left, a warning message about the status appears on the dashboard. The message gives the option to go to the transaction history tab
  -The transaction history tab provides a simple overview of completed transactions, offering a statistical display of the bikes that are most often sold (and other        useful statistical parameters)
